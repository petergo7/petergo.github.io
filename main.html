            <h2>A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
            <p>
                Hello World! My name is Peter Go. I live in Japan and love to launch model rockets along with coding as another little hobby. I want to do a lot of things, like make a self driving bike (electric, ofc) and also want to make a multi-first-stage model rocket. When I grow up, I also want to work at NASA or JPL. Hope you have a nice day!
            </p>
            <h2>Quick Note</h2>
            <p>
                This webpage doesn't use cookies or anything, and feel free to look at my source code (button redirect to github above)! This webpage is hosted on GitHub Pages (which I think is cool) and is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScirpt, and other file formats. I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE and really just do this as a side hobby, often just relieving stress by working on the webpage, which is why my code <i>might</i> not be that efficient. But, all in all, I use a light theme in VSCode (Sorry, it just looks good with my room).
