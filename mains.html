            <h1><strong>

            </h1></strong>
            <h2><b>
                A bit about myself
            </h2></b>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Peter Go, and I love rockets and engineering. I currently have worked at SpinLaunch as an intern during my PhD at CALTECH, and have worked the last 13 years at SpaceX as an accountant for their Low Earth Orbit (LEO) station construction division. Since then, I have traveled around the world, learning new languages, experiencing new things, visiting different launches, and also meeting a lot of new people. Unsuprisingly, this was quite the investment. 
                <br></br>
                My strengths include working with numbers, on large projects, with groups, three-dimensional modelling, prototyping with quick turnarounds, and developing concepts or ideas into actual working mechanisms. I have a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and computer science, along with a PhD in aerospace engineering.
                <br></br>
                Working for 13 years as an accountant, I took 2 years off of working to travel the world has many reasons. For myself, I saw this as a new investment, travelling across the world, learning new knowledge, meeting friends, and also gathering insight on the local market. I used this time and my entire budget to learn what people in the area needed, and wanted, looking into the cultures in the area, and experiencing new technologies and concepts too. 
            </p>
