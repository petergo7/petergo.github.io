            Hello! My name is Peter Go!
        </h1>
        <p>
            I'm from Korea, but have lived in Hong Kong for 2 years, and have been in Japan for 5 years from 3rd Grade.

            Some of my hobbies include coding, building model rockets, and making functional 3D models! So far, I've launched a model rocket built by me up to 33 meters, and one given to me up to around 200 to 300 meters. I also usually code in Python for the Raspberry Pi, but can also code in Swift and SwiftUI and a little bit of Javascript.

            When I grow up, I want to make a rocket company like SpaceX and make satellite deployment more affordable.
